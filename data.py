# Step 1. Read the Seat-Level Data
# -----------------------------

# (Optional) Ensure proper datatypes (if needed)
# Here we assume GameDate is already in an acceptable format and the flags are numeric (0/1).
# If needed, you could convert the "weekday/weekend game" and "Promotional game" columns as follows:
# df_seat['weekday/weekend game'] = pd.to_numeric(df_seat['weekday/weekend game'], errors='coerce')
# df_seat['Promotional game'] = pd.to_numeric(df_seat['Promotional game'], errors='coerce')

# -----------------------------
# Step 2. Aggregate Data by Account (and Season)

    # For this example, we will set GamesAttended equal to the distinct games attended.
    distinct_game_count = group["Game"].nunique()
    rec["GamesAttended"] = distinct_game_count

    # Append the account record
    account_records.append(rec)

# Create the aggregated DataFrame
df_account = pd.DataFrame(account_records)

# -----------------------------
# Step 3. Reorder Columns as Specified
# -----------------------------
# The desired final column order is:
col_order = [
    "Season", "AccountNumber", "SingleGameTickets", "PartialPlanTickets", "GroupTickets", "STM", "AvgSpend",
    "GamesAttended", "FanSegment", "DistanceToArena", "BasketballPropensity", "SocialMediaEngagement",

    "B + Weekend + Promo", "B + Weekend + nonPromo", "B + Weekday + Promo", "B + Weekday + nonPromo",
    "C + Weekend + Promo", "C + Weekend + nonPromo", "C + Weekday + Promo", "C + Weekday + nonPromo",
    "D + Weekend + Promo", "D + Weekend + nonPromo", "D + Weekday + Promo", "D + Weekday + nonPromo",
    "NumGamesAttend"
]

# Some of these columns might have been created in the loop; ensure they exist:
for col in col_order:
    if col not in df_account.columns:
        df_account[col] = 0

df_account = df_account[col_order]

# -----------------------------
# Step 4. Write the Account-Level File
# -----------------------------
accountlevel_file = "Prompt1AccountLevel.csv"
df_account.to_csv(accountlevel_file, index=False)

print(f"Aggregated account-level data saved to {accountlevel_file}")
